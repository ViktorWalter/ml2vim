19990202
  First error-free build of a "proof-of-concept": 0.99.0

19990218
  First alpha version released: 0.99.7

  Refined the protocol used when talking to Vim:
  Meta-messages REFRESH and EOC are defined and will be handled.

  Added options: 
    --piggyback, --refresh

  Added support for command line options:
    --help, --version, --debug
  A trace() mechanism is defined which will produce lots of
  diagnostic output when --debug is given on the command line.

  Many minor bugs eliminated.

  Added support for viewers

  Added option --suppress-... ,  removed obsolete option --display

  Added include-mechanism (similar to C's #include)
  This required another refinement of the protocol: Tags may now,
  in certain cases, include ranges of numbers instead of single
  numbers.
